JavaScript Filter Fun is a repository that provides a photo filter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to apply different image filters to their photos, such as grayscale, sepia, and invert, among others.

The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the photo filter application. The HTML files include the basic structure for the application and user interface, while the CSS files provide the styling and layout of the photo filter options. The JavaScript files contain the logic and algorithms for applying different image filters to the uploaded photos.

Users can upload their own photos to the application and apply different filters to them, previewing the results before saving the final edited image. The application is responsive and optimized for different screen sizes and devices.

Developers can also customize the application by modifying the JavaScript code or adding new features. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
